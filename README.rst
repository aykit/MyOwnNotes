 MyOwnNotes 2
==============

This is Version 2, a complete rewrite of MyOwnNotes. This application does not depend on the server side owncloud notes app anymore. However, it does depend on the `ownCloud android application`_ for authentication.

MyOwnNotes 2 has not been released on the official android store yet. Release will follow in the next couple of weeks. Feel free to add issues after consulting the CONTRIBUTING.rst file.


The right README
================
Make sure you read the README of the appropriate branch. The one you are seeing right now might not be the one you are looking for.
